# Content Alignment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive content alignment work performed to ensure all website content accurately reflects the source documents "THE FOREVERBOX INITIATIVE.md" and "forever fit.md" as the content bibles.

## Problem Statement
The website contained fictional case studies and misrepresented Forever Fit as clinical programs rather than the digital health app described in the source documents. Content needed to be fully built around the source documents, not just minimally included.

## Changes Made

### 1. Case Studies Page (`pages/case-studies.php`)
**Before:** Featured three fictional case studies (Sarah, Marcus, Alex) that do not appear in source documents.

**After:** 
- Removed all fictional case studies
- Replaced with only **Case Study Delta: Dr. Zeon7 (Founder)** from THE FOREVERBOX INITIATIVE.md

  - Phase Three: Integration, Monitoring, and Optimisation (Years 4-7)
- Added all key metrics from source document:
  - Duration: 7 years (ongoing)
  - 47 targeted genetic modifications
  - Olfactory enhancement: 10,000x

- Included psychological and philosophical impact section
- Added clarification that hybrid augmentation is experimental, not commercial
