- Laboratory and facility photography
- Welsh landscape imagery
- Scientific visualizations
- Abstract/conceptual images

### Priority Images Listed
1. Dr. Zeon7 professional portrait (main)
2. Homepage hero background
3. Forever Fit app mockups
4. Page hero images

### Implementation Ready
All placeholder divs can be easily replaced with actual images by:
- Adding images to `/images/` directory
- Updating PHP files to use `<img>` tags or CSS backgrounds
- Adding appropriate alt text
