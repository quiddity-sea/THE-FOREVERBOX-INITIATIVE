## For End Users

### What This Page Is About
The Origin page reveals the personal and scientific journey behind The ForeverBox Initiative. It's where you'll learn about:

- **Breaking Twelve Years of Silence**: The story of why Dr. Zeon7 remained silent until achieving proof
- **The Snowdonia Childhood**: Early life experiences that shaped the mission
- **The Lupine Transformation**: Dr. Zeon7's own lived experience as Case Study Delta
- **The Dark Period**: Years of failures, doubts, and persistence
- **The North Wales Breakthrough**: The quantum-biological discoveries that changed everything

### How to Use This Page
- **Read chronologically**: The page unfolds like a timeline, revealing the story in narrative order
- **Pay attention to the timeline**: Key dates and milestones mark major achievements
- **Connect with the mission**: This isn't just science—it's a deeply personal journey
- **Understand the "why"**: Learn what drives this initiative beyond pure research

### Key Takeaways
1. The ForeverBox Initiative was born from personal necessity and scientific curiosity
2. Dr. Zeon7 is both the researcher and the primary case study
3. Twelve years of secretive work preceded the public launch
4. The breakthrough came from combining quantum biology with AI-guided reprogramming
5. Snowdonia, North Wales is the physical and spiritual home of this work

## For Developers

### Page Purpose and Role
The Origin page serves as the narrative foundation and emotional anchor of the site. It:
- Establishes credibility through personal investment
- Creates emotional connection with the audience
- Provides context for the scientific claims on other pages
- Sets the tone for the entire site experience

### Technical Implementation

**File Location**: `/pages/origin.php`

**Database Integration**: 
- Pulls content from `pages` table where `slug = 'origin'`
- Renders sections from `content_sections` table linked to origin page_id
- Uses dynamic page template: `/includes/page-template.php`

**Color Scheme**:
- Primary: `#1a237e` (deep blue)
- Secondary: `#3949ab` (lighter blue)
- Tailwind classes: `from-origin-primary`, `via-origin-secondary`

**Key Sections**:
1. Hero section with parallax effect
2. Prologue ("Breaking Twelve Years of Silence")
3. Timeline component (interactive on scroll)
4. Personal narrative sections
5. Call-to-action leading to Science page

### Development Guidelines

**Adding/Editing Content**:
1. Use admin panel at `/admin` or directly update database
2. Content stored in `content_sections` table
3. Maintain narrative flow and emotional tone
4. Keep sections focused and digestible

**Animation Classes Used**:
- `.fade-in` - For text paragraphs
- `.slide-left` - For headings
- `.hero-section` with `.hero-bg` - Parallax hero effect
- Custom timeline animations (if implementing)

**Accessibility Considerations**:
- Timeline must be keyboard-navigable
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (blues on black background)
- Provide text alternatives for any visual timeline elements
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

**Linking Strategy**:
- Links to Science page (to explain the breakthrough)
- Links to Case Studies page (Dr. Zeon7 as Delta)
- Minimal external links to maintain immersion

### Code Structure
```php
<?php
// Origin page uses dynamic template
include __DIR__ . '/../includes/page-template.php';
?>
```

The page template handles:
- Database connection
- Content fetching
- Section rendering
- Header/footer includes

### Common Development Tasks

**Update Hero Content**:
```sql
UPDATE pages 
SET title = 'New Title', subtitle = 'New Subtitle' 
WHERE slug = 'origin';
```

**Add New Section**:
```sql
INSERT INTO content_sections (page_id, heading, body, section_order) 
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE slug = 'origin'),
  'Section Heading',
  'Section content...',
  10
);
```

**Change Color Scheme**:
Update in `includes/header.php` Tailwind config:
```javascript
origin: {
  primary: '#1a237e',
  secondary: '#3949ab'
}
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Database content renders correctly
- [ ] Hero gradient displays properly
- [ ] Animations trigger on scroll
- [ ] Links navigate correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout works
- [ ] Reduced motion preference respected
- [ ] Color contrast passes WCAG AA

### Database Schema
```sql

SELECT * FROM pages WHERE slug = 'origin';

-- Origin page sections
SELECT * FROM content_sections 
WHERE page_id = (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE slug = 'origin')
ORDER BY section_order;
```
