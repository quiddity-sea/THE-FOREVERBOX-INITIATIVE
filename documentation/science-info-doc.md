## For End Users

### What This Page Is About
The Science page demystifies the breakthrough technology behind The ForeverBox Initiative:

- **Quantum-Biological Convergence**: How quantum computing meets cellular biology
- **Three Pillars**: Epigenetic Reprogramming, Morphological Reconfiguration, Hybrid Augmentation
- **The Neurodivergence Hypothesis**: Why ADHD and autism may be advantages in transformation
- **Computational Architecture**: The four-layer system that makes it work
- **Safety and Ethics**: How the science is conducted responsibly

### How to Use This Page
- **Don't panic if it's technical**: Complex concepts are explained in plain language
- **Focus on the pillars**: These are the three main areas of work
- **Visual learners**: Look for diagrams and visual representations
- **Connect to applications**: See how science translates to Forever Fit app
- **Ask questions**: Contact information is available if you need clarification

### Key Takeaways
1. Three distinct but interconnected pillars of transformation
2. Quantum computing accelerates biological understanding
3. Neurodivergent brains may respond differently (and better) to interventions
4. The technology is experimental but grounded in real science
5. Safety protocols are rigorous and comprehensive

## For Developers

### Page Purpose and Role
The Science page serves as the technical credibility foundation:
- Explains the "how" behind the claims
- Bridges hard science with practical applications
- Targets scientifically-minded audience members
- Supports claims made on other pages with concrete methodology

### Technical Implementation

**File Location**: `/pages/science.php`

**Database Integration**: 
- Content from `pages` table where `slug = 'science'`
- Sections from `content_sections` table
- Uses dynamic page template

**Color Scheme**:
- Primary: `#004d40` (teal)
- Secondary: `#00897b` (lighter teal)
- Tailwind classes: `from-science-primary`, `via-science-secondary`

**Key Sections**:
1. Hero section with scientific imagery
2. Quantum-Biological Convergence introduction
3. Three Pillars (card layout)
4. Computational Architecture diagram
5. Neurodivergence Hypothesis section
6. Safety and ethics statement

### Development Guidelines

**Content Structure**:
- Use cards or columns for the three pillars
- Include visual representations where possible
- Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- Link to Forever Fit page for practical application

**Animation Classes**:
- `.fade-in` - Text content
- `.slide-right` - Pillar cards
- `.stagger-list` - Technical points lists
- `.scale-image` - Scientific imagery

**Accessibility**:
- Complex diagrams need text descriptions
- Scientific terms need plain-language explanations
- Color coding should not be the only differentiator
- Ensure formulas/equations have alt text

**Visual Elements**:
- Three-pillar layout (responsive grid)
- Icons or imagery for each pillar
- Computational architecture diagram
- DNA/quantum computing imagery placeholders

### Code Structure
```php
<?php
// Science page uses dynamic template
include __DIR__ . '/../includes/page-template.php';
?>
```

### Common Development Tasks

**Update Pillar Content**:
```sql
UPDATE content_sections 
SET heading = 'New Pillar Name', body = 'Updated description'
WHERE page_id = (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE slug = 'science')
  AND section_order = [pillar_number];
```

**Add Technical Details**:
- Store in content_sections with appropriate section_order
- Use HTML formatting in body field for structure
- Consider JSON field for complex data structures

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All three pillars render correctly
- [ ] Scientific terminology is accurate
- [ ] Plain-language explanations are clear
- [ ] Diagrams/images load properly
- [ ] Color scheme is consistent
- [ ] Links to related pages work
- [ ] Mobile layout doesn't break complex layouts
