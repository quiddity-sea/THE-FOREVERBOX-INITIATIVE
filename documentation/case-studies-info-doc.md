## For Developers

### Page Purpose and Role
Case Studies page provides social proof and evidence:
- Shows real results, not just theory
- Demonstrates long-term commitment
- Builds trust through transparency
- Sets realistic expectations for timeline

### Technical Implementation

**File Location**: `/pages/case-studies.php`

**Database Integration**: 
- Content from `pages` table where `slug = 'case-studies'`
- Individual case studies from `content_sections`
- Consider separate `case_studies` table for structured data

**Color Scheme**:
- Primary: `#b71c1c` (red)
- Secondary: `#e53935` (lighter red)
- Tailwind classes: `from-cases-primary`, `via-cases-secondary`

**Key Sections**:
1. Hero section emphasizing "Real Impact, Real Results"
2. Case Study Delta detailed presentation
3. Timeline visualization (7-year journey)
4. Before/after metrics comparison
5. Ethical disclosure section
6. Future case studies placeholder

### Development Guidelines

**Content Structure**:
- Each case study as separate section or component
- Timeline component for transformation progression
- Data tables for metrics
- Image placeholders for before/after photos
- Ethical disclaimers prominently displayed

**Animation Classes**:
- `.fade-in` - Case study cards
- `.slide-left` / `.slide-right` - Alternating sections
- `.counter` - Animated metrics (use data-target attribute)
- Timeline-specific animations

**Data Display**:
- Use tables for metrics comparison
- Timeline should be responsive
- Consider expandable sections for detailed data
- Graphs/charts for visual data representation

### Code Structure
```php
<?php
// Case studies page uses dynamic template
include __DIR__ . '/../includes/page-template.php';
?>
```

### Common Development Tasks

**Add New Case Study**:
```sql
INSERT INTO content_sections (page_id, heading, body, section_order)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE slug = 'case-studies'),
  'Case Study [Name]',
  'Detailed case study content...',
  [next_order_number]
);
```

**Update Metrics**:
- Store structured data in JSON format
- Update via admin panel or direct SQL
- Ensure data validation for numerical values

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Case Study Delta displays completely
- [ ] Timeline is interactive and responsive
- [ ] Metrics are accurate and formatted properly
- [ ] Ethical disclaimers are visible
- [ ] No fictional content remains
- [ ] Links to related pages work
