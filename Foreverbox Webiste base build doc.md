* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS framework preferred), JavaScript ES6+  
* **Libraries:** jQuery for DOM manipulation, AJAX for dynamic content loading  
* **Animation:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for all visual transitions, scroll-triggered animations, and interactive flourishes  
* **Responsive:** Mobile-first design, fully responsive across devices  
* **Performance:** Lazy loading for images, optimised asset delivery, minimal render-blocking

* **Sensory considerations:** Avoid flashing animations, provide volume controls for any audio

**DEVELOPMENT PHASES:** **Phase 1:** Home page with navigation, basic structure, GSAP setup **Phase 2:** Origin Story and Science pages with full content integration **Phase 3:** Case Studies page with database integration **Phase 4:** Forever Fit and Investment pages **Phase 5:** Vision and About/Contact pages **Phase 6:** Polish, performance optimization, accessibility audit, testing **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

* Site loads in under 3 seconds on 3G connection  
* All animations run at 60fps  
* Lighthouse scores: 90+ across all categories  
* Emotionally resonant: user feedback confirms inspiration and trust  
* Conversion-ready: clear pathways for investors and clients

This website must feel like stepping into the future—bold, grounded in rigorous science, deeply human, and unapologetically transformative. Every pixel, every animation, every word should reinforce ForeverBox's mission: giving people tools to become more fully themselves.

Build with precision, empathy, and ambition. This is not just a website—it's a manifesto made visible.
